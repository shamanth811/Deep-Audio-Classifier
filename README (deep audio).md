## Overview
This project aims to classify audio clips by extracting and analyzing features using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It is designed for anyone working with large audio datasets, such as researchers in bioacoustics, conservation, or those developing audio-based applications in entertainment and machine learning.

## Features
- **Audio Preprocessing**: Extracts audio features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
- **CNN + LSTM Architecture**: Combines CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for sequential pattern recognition.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Handles classification of multiple categories of audio data.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for large datasets in a variety of domains.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shamanth811/Deep-Audio-Classifier.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Deep-Audio-Classifier
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and organize it in the following structure:
    ```
    /data
      /class1
        audio1.wav
        audio2.wav
        ...
      /class2
        audio1.wav
        audio2.wav
        ...
    ```
2. Modify the configuration file (if any) to specify dataset paths and hyperparameters.
3. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py --data_dir /path/to/your/dataset --epochs 50
    ```
4. Test the model:
    ```bash
    python test.py --data_dir /path/to/test/dataset
    ```
